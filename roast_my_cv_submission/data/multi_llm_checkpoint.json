This profile reads like a highly ambitious intern who spent four years doing help desk work while reading textbooks on the side.

The career objective is vague corporate word salad, the skills are just a dumped list, and the work experience section is essentially empty. For someone claiming 4+ years at a major company like Coca-Cola, this is alarmingly thin.\n\n## MAJOR ISSUES:\n\n**1. The Career Objective is Useless**\n- \"Handling all kinds of data\" - what does this even mean?\n- \"Well acquainted with\" - weak, vague language\n- \"More of development\" - development of what? This isn't a clear goal\n- DELETE THIS SECTION. It adds nothing.\n\n**2. Work Experience is a Disaster**\n- You've been at Coca-Cola for 4+ years and can only list generic one-word bullet points?\n- \"Technical Support\"? \"Collaboration\"? These aren't responsibilities - they're meaningless buzzwords\n- **No metrics, no projects, no actual achievements**\n- No technologies mentioned despite claiming Big Data expertise\n- Where's the Hadoop? The Spark? The actual work you did?\n- This is the most important section and it's completely hollow\n\n**3. Skills Section is a Random Dump**\n- 21 technologies listed with zero context\n- How proficient are you in each? \n- Which have you actually used professionally vs. touched once in school?\n- The list format (with brackets) looks unprofessional\n\n**4. The \"Coca-COla\" Typo**\n- Seriously? You can't spell your own employer's name correctly?\n- This screams carelessness\n\n## CONCERNS:\n\n- **Experience-Skills Mismatch**: You list all these Big Data tools but show ZERO evidence of using them\n- **Job Title vs. Content**: \"Big Data Analyst\" but your responsibilities read like IT helpdesk\n- **Education-Job Gap**: Electronics degree to Big Data role - no explanation of transition\n- **Credibility**: Did you actually do Big Data work or just support the team that did?\n- **\"Till Date\"**: Use \"Present\" - sounds more professional\n\n## WHAT WORKS:\n\n- You have a degree from a recognized institution\n- You've held a position at a major brand name company\n- The technical skills list (if genuine) shows breadth\n\n## BOTTOM LINE:\n\n**This CV would get rejected in 30 seconds.** It reads like you're hiding something - either you didn't actually do substantive work, or you don't know how to articulate what you did. Neither looks good.\n\n### PRIORITY FIXES (in order):\n\n1. **REWRITE the work experience section completely**\n   - Add 5-7 actual bullet points with real projects\n   - Include metrics (data volumes, performance improvements, cost savings)\n   - Name the technologies you used\n   - Example: \"Built Spark-based ETL pipeline processing 500GB daily transaction data, reducing processing time by 40%\"\n\n2. **Delete the career objective** - replace with a 2-3 line professional summary with actual substance\n\n3. **Fix the typo** in Coca-Cola\n\n4. **Reorganize skills** - group by category (Big Data Tools, Programming, Cloud, etc.) and indicate proficiency levels\n\n5. **Add context** - Include 1-2 significant projects or achievements\n\n**Hard truth**: If this represents 4 years at Coca-Cola accurately, you might not be ready for a development-focused role. If you DID do substantial work, you need to completely rewrite this to show it. Either way, this version is unemployable.",

This is either:\n- A template disaster where you pasted the wrong content\n- An attempt to use some automated tool that failed spectacularly\n- A sign you don't understand what you're applying for\n\n**No actual accomplishments or results.** Even if the responsibilities were correct, there are zero metrics, achievements, or outcomes. \"Managed month-end close\" means nothing without context.\n\n**\"Company Name\" repeated 5 times.** This looks like you forgot to fill in the template. If these are real positions, NAME THE COMPANIES. If you're trying to anonymize for this review, fine, but it looks unprofessional.\n\n**The skills section is a dump.** You've listed \"accounting\" three times in different formats, plus a random array of keywords that reads like you're trying to game an ATS system. \"AR\" and \"accounts receivable\" are the same thing. \"Client\" and \"clients\" are not skills.\n\n**Career objective is pure fluff.** \"Outstanding work ethic and integrity\" - everyone says this. \"Make a valuable contribution\" - meaningless. This entire section wastes space saying nothing.\n\n## CONCERNS\n\n- **No graduation year?** How do I know when you completed your degree? This raises questions about whether you actually graduated.\n\n- **No CPA?** You've been working since 2006 (17+ years) and have no certifications listed? For an accountant, this is a red flag. If you have your CPA, it should be prominently displayed. If you don't after nearly two decades, that's concerning.\n\n- **Overlapping dates.** You show two positions both starting in January 2016, with one being current and one ending January 2016. This makes no sense.\n\n- **Job title progression is unclear.** You went from Staff Auditor to Staff Accountant to Tax Analyst to Senior Accountant to Staff Accountant? That's backwards career progression.\n\n## WHAT WORKS\n\n- You have a degree from a legitimate university in the right field\n- You appear to have relevant experience spanning many years (if the dates are accurate)\n- The job titles themselves are appropriate for accounting work\n\nThat's about it.\n\n## BOTTOM LINE\n\n**This CV would be immediately rejected.** The iOS development content in the work experience section is a dealbreaker - it suggests carelessness, use of a broken template, or dishonesty.

The iOS Experience Problem**\n- Your entire work history is iOS development\n- None of your \"responsibilities\" connect to your listed skills\n- Are you applying for iOS roles or data science roles?

Responsibilities are Buzzword Soup**\n- \"iOS Lifecycle\" - what does this even mean as a responsibility?\n- \"Technical Communication\" - everyone communicates\n- \"Feature Collaboration\" - you collaborated on features, got it\n- These aren't responsibilities, they're generic task names with zero context\n- NO metrics, NO achievements, NO actual impact\n\n**4.

Either you've pasted the wrong content or this is severely mismatched. The skills section is a dumping ground of 50+ random keywords that screams \"I'm gaming ATS systems.\"\n\n## MAJOR ISSUES\n\n**Critical Mismatch**: Your work experience responsibilities are for a SOFTWARE DEVELOPER (iOS, API Integration, Native Frameworks) but your job titles are ENGINEERING TECHNICIAN, INSTRUMENT TECHNICIAN, and PROJECT MANAGER ASSISTANCE. This makes zero sense. If this went to an employer, they'd assume you either:\n- Can't follow basic instructions\n- Copy-pasted someone else's CV\n- Are lying about your experience\n\n**Anonymous Companies**: \"Company Name\" three times? Really? This looks like you forgot to fill in a template. No employer will take this seriously.\n\n**Vague Timeline**: \"January 2013 to Current\" is 11+ years as an Engineering Technician with no progression? That's a red flag. The other roles have only years, not specific dates.\n\n**Skills Overload**: 50+ skills listed as a word salad. \"And Humidity\" is listed as a separate skill. \"Entry Level\" and \"Proactive\" aren't skills. This looks desperate and unfocused.\n\n## CONCERNS\n\n- No achievements, metrics, or results anywhere\n- No context for what these companies do or your actual impact\n- Bachelor's degree from 2009, but first job listed starts 2005?

Add specific equipment, systems, and tools you've actually worked with\n7.
