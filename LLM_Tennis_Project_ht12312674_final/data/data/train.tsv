The Australian Open champion ultimately proved too consistent from the baseline for Moutet, who battled admirably throughout but struggled to counter his opponent’s power across the second, third and fourth sets.

In a gruelling clash, Sinner played with relentless intensity to grind down Draper, who struggled physically from the closing stages of the second set. The top seed fired 42 winners and survived a scare of his own in the second set when he tweaked his left wrist after using it to cushion his fall when he stumbled behind the baseline."

Zverev successfully landed 85 per cent of his first serves and went on to win 73 per cent (69/94) of points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys Stats. His serve was the foundation for his dominance in the opening two and a half sets, when the German backed them up with some of his cleanest groundstrokes of the fortnight as he consistently absorbed Alcaraz’s power to great effect to move to the verge of victory at 6-1, 6-2, 5-2.
Alcaraz kick-started a comeback, however, when he broke Zverev for the first time in the match as the German served for victory at 5-3 in the third set.

In one of the most anticipated matches of the year, both players struggled to find their best level in the opening two sets. With the match all square at one set all, Alcaraz looked to gain control when Sinner suffered with hand cramp at 2-2 in the third set. The Italian regularly shook out his hand between points and although his service speed dropped in the game, he saved four break points to survive on serve before he received treatment at 3-2.
Sinner came out firing on the resumption to break Alcaraz immediately and held firm on serve to move ahead. Alcaraz refused to surrender in the fourth, though, with both players striking the ball with clean and effortless timing. With little to separate them, the World No. 3 Alcaraz found more quality and intensity in his play at the end of the fourth set to win it and force a decider.
The 21-year-old then produced moments of magic in an absorbing fifth set, breaking Sinner’s serve early with a fierce forehand winner. Alcaraz put his foot down from that moment and refused to let Sinner back in, sealing a mammoth victory on his third match point after four hours and 10 minutes. Alcaraz, who struck 65 winners to Sinner's 39, raised his arms in the air and embraced the roar from the crowd after sealing his win."	"You are a tennis journalist.
