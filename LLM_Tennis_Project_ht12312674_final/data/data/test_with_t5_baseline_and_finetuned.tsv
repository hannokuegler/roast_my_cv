Djokovic has been pushed to the limit by Rune in the past, with the Dane winning two of their previous five Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings, including the Rolex Paris Masters final in 2022.
However, the 21-year-old struggled to impose his aggressive game on Djokovic under the roof on Centre Court, where the Serbian hugged the baseline to control the tempo of the match. The seven-time champion dominated on serve throughout, winning 75 per cent of first serves and an eye-popping 72 per cent of second serves. Djokovic also saved the two break points he faced to earn his most impressive win of this year’s Championships after two hours and three minutes."	"You are a tennis journalist.
