      "Honey, this CV reads like a ransom note written by a bot that just finished a \"Data Science for Dummies\" course. It's so generic, I'm pretty sure I saw it advertised on a bathroom stall next to a plea for spare change. Let's dissect this dumpster fire, shall we?\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Big data analytics working and database warehouse manager with robust experience...\" Oh, so you want to be *everything*? You're like a Swiss Army knife, but instead of useful tools, you just have a rusty spoon and a broken corkscrew. \"Currently in search of role that offers more of development.\" Translation: \"I'm bored with what I'm doing, but I'm too scared to actually say what I *want* to do.\" You want *more* of development? More of what? More coding? More debugging? More existential dread? Be specific, darling! It's a career objective, not a vague wish to the genie in a bottle of stale Mountain Dew.\n",

      "**SKILLS SECTION COMEDY:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh my sweet summer child. You've listed every buzzword in the data universe. \"Big Data,\" \"Hadoop,\" \"Hive,\" \"Spark,\" \"Cloud,\" \"Data Science\" ... it's like you threw a dart at a whiteboard covered in tech jargon. I bet you learned all of these from youtube videos and are now suffering from imposter syndrome. You are telling me you are proficient in both C++ and Python? You must be one of those coding gods everyone fears. Is there anything you *can't* do? Besides write a coherent sentence, apparently.\n",

      "**EXPERIENCE REALITY CHECK:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Coca-Cola, huh? \"Big Data Analyst.\" I bet that means you ran reports on which flavor of soda is rotting our teeth faster. \"Technical Support,\" \"Troubleshooting,\" \"Collaboration,\" \"Documentation\"... This sounds like a slightly glorified IT helpdesk job. \"Field Visits\"? Did you personally deliver the secret formula? Did you visit farmers and give them pep talks about their ingredients? \"Training & Mentorship\"? You trained someone how to pour a Coke?\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Electronics background:** You went to school for electronics and now you are in Data Analytics, how?\n",
      "*   **\"Till Date\":** Seriously? \"Till Date?\" Are you expecting me to believe you're still employed there, but you're actively looking for a job?\n",
      "*   **The Buzzword Blizzard:** You've crammed every trendy term into this thing like you're trying to win a buzzword bingo tournament.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Specificity:** What *exactly* do you *do*? What problems did you solve? What were the results? This CV is so vague; it's practically invisible.\n",
      "\n",
      "**MIC DROP:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Congratulations, sweetie. You've crafted a CV so spectacularly underwhelming, it's almost impressive. You are basically a 2019 B.Tech. Electronics graduate who jumped on the hype train of Data Analytics after watching a few youtube videos and now is looking for validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "You're going to need more than a list of skills and vague job descriptions to land a gig. Go back to the drawing board, figure out what you *actually* want, and then write a CV that doesn't sound like it was generated by a Markov chain. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need a drink. Preferably not a Coke.\n",
