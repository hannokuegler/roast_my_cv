      "Okay, I'd be happy to review your CV and offer some constructive feedback. Here's my take:\n",
      "\n",
      "**STRENGTHS:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   You've clearly identified a target role in your career objective.\n",
      "*   You have a good range of technical skills listed, showcasing your expertise in Big Data, Cloud technologies, and programming languages.\n",
      "*   You've included relevant keywords (like Hadoop, Spark, Azure) which can help your CV get noticed by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).\n",
      "*   Listing your work experience, even with brief descriptions, provides a foundation for demonstrating your capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Career Objective:** The career objective is a bit generic. It could be more impactful by specifying the type of development role you're seeking and hinting at what you can bring to a potential employer.\n",
      "*   **Skills:** While the list is comprehensive, it lacks context. Consider quantifying your proficiency level in each skill (e.g., \"Proficient in Python,\" \"Experienced with Azure data services\").\n",
      "*   **Education:** It's good you've included your education, but consider adding your GPA if it's strong.\n",
      "*   **Work Experience:** This section needs the most work. The responsibilities listed are very general. You need to quantify your achievements and showcase the impact you made in your role. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your descriptions.\n",
      "*   **Formatting:** The formatting is very basic. Consider using bullet points to break up text and improve readability. Also, ensure consistent formatting throughout.\n",
      "\n",
      "**ACTION ITEMS:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Refine Career Objective:** Rewrite it to be more specific about the development role you desire (e.g., \"Seeking a Data Engineer role focused on building scalable data pipelines using Spark and Cloud technologies\"). Highlight your key strengths and what you can offer the company.\n",
      "2.  **Quantify Skills:** Instead of just listing skills, add a brief descriptor of your proficiency level or how you've used the skill (e.g., \"Python: Proficient in developing data analysis scripts and machine learning models\").\n",
      "3.  **Enhance Work Experience:**\n",
      "    *   For each responsibility, use the STAR method to describe a specific accomplishment. For example, instead of \"Technical Support,\" write: \"Provided technical support to over 50 users, resolving critical data pipeline issues and reducing downtime by 15%.\"\n",
      "    *   Quantify your achievements whenever possible (e.g., \"Improved data processing speed by X%\").\n",
      "    *   Focus on accomplishments that align with the development role you're seeking.\n",
      "4.  **Education Details:** If your GPA is good, include it.\n",
      "5.  **Formatting:** Use a professional resume template. Ensure consistent formatting for dates, job titles, and descriptions. Use bullet points to make your responsibilities easier to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "**FINAL THOUGHTS:**\n",
      "\n",
      "You have a solid foundation to build upon! By focusing on quantifying your achievements and tailoring your resume to the specific development roles you're targeting, you can significantly increase your chances of success. Don't be afraid to showcase your accomplishments and highlight the value you can bring to a potential employer. You've got this!\n",
