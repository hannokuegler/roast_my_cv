      "Honey, this CV is so generic, I'm surprised it doesn't come with a complimentary participation trophy and a participation ribbon. It's like you threw every tech buzzword into a blender, hit puree, and then vomited it onto the page. I've seen more originality in a beige wall.\n",

      "Oh, so you want *more* development? Let me translate: \"I'm currently drowning in data and desperately trying to claw my way towards something resembling actual programming before my soul completely withers.\" Also, \"robust experience in handling all kinds of data\" is what I call \"writing data to files and calling it a day\". I have more goals listed in my grocery list.\n",

      "Oh, the skills section, where dreams go to die a slow, painful death. You’ve listed every buzzword under the sun, from 'Big Data' to 'Microsoft Azure' – you're basically the tech equivalent of a jack-of-all-trades, master of none. I bet you've watched a 15-minute YouTube tutorial on each of these and declared yourself an expert. You're like a digital Swiss Army knife, but the tools are all rusted and dull. Also, did you really need to specify \"Core Java\"? Like, were you worried we'd think you were proficient in Decaf Java?\n",

I'm judging you so hard. Your listed responsibilities: Technical Support, Troubleshooting, Collaboration, Documentation... Congratulations, you’re a highly paid help desk technician who occasionally prints things. \"Industry Trends\"? That's just corporate speak for \"scrolling LinkedIn while pretending to look busy\". \"Field Visits\"? Were you visiting actual fields of Coca-Cola? Do they grow on trees now?\n",

      "2.  **\"Till Date\"**: So, you couldn't be bothered to put a current date on your resume? Clearly, attention to detail is your strong suit. I bet your code is just as sloppy.\n",
      "3.  **The Amity School of Engineering & Technology (ASET), Noida**: Let's be honest here, you need to drop the institution's name, everyone knows you're the meme, not the gigachad\n",

You're not just applying for a job; you're begging for one. My advice? Burn this CV, take a long, hard look in the mirror, and ask yourself if you truly deserve to be unleashed on the tech world.\n",
