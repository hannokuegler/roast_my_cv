You've thrown in C++, because who doesn't love a good middle-aged language. Then you've got Informatica and Talend, because nobody wants to code when they can drag and drop. I'm guessing you also know how to use a stapler and attend meetings, but you left those off, sadly. It's so impressive I am sure your colleagues will be amazed.\n",
