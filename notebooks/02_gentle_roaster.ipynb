      "**STRENGTHS:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   You have a good foundation of technical skills. Listing them out like this is a great way to get past the ATS (Applicant Tracking System).\n",
      "*   You've clearly identified your desired career path (development-focused role).\n",
      "*   Including your work experience at Coca-Cola is excellent, and the listed responsibilities provide a glimpse into your contributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Career Objective:** The current objective is a bit generic. It could be more targeted and compelling. Instead of just stating what you *are*, try to convey what you *want to achieve* and *how you can benefit the company*.\n",
      "*   **Skills:** While the list is comprehensive, it lacks context. Consider adding a brief proficiency level (e.g., \"Proficient in Python,\" \"Experienced with Hadoop\") or, even better, integrating these skills into your work experience descriptions to showcase how you've *used* them.\n",
      "*   **Education:** Consider adding your GPA if it's above average.\n",
      "*   **Work Experience:** This is the area that needs the most attention. The responsibilities listed are quite generic. You need to quantify your achievements and demonstrate the impact you made. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your descriptions.\n",
      "*   **Formatting:** The CV lacks visual appeal. Consider using bullet points, bolding, and consistent formatting to improve readability. Also, ensure consistent tense (past tense for previous roles, present tense for current roles).\n",

For example: \"Data Engineer seeking a development-focused role at \\[Company Name] to leverage expertise in cloud infrastructure and big data technologies to build scalable and efficient data pipelines.\"\n",
      "2.  **Contextualize Skills:** Integrate your skills into your work experience descriptions. For example, instead of just listing \"Python,\" describe a project where you used Python to automate a task or analyze data.\n",
      "3.  **Quantify Achievements:** For each responsibility at Coca-Cola, think about how you can quantify your impact. For example:\n",
      "    *   Instead of \"Technical Support,\" try \"Provided technical support to over 50 users, resolving 95% of issues within SLA.\"\n",
      "    *   Instead of \"System Monitoring,\" try \"Developed and implemented a system monitoring dashboard using \\[Tool] that reduced system downtime by 15%.\"\n",
      "4.  **Use the STAR Method:** Structure your work experience descriptions using the STAR method to provide context and highlight your contributions.\n",
      "    *   **Situation:** Briefly describe the context or challenge you faced.\n",
      "    *   **Task:** Explain your responsibilities and goals.\n",
      "    *   **Action:** Detail the specific actions you took to address the challenge.\n",
      "    *   **Result:** Quantify the outcomes of your actions (e.g., improved efficiency, reduced costs, increased revenue).\n",
      "5.  **Add a Projects Section (Optional):** If you have personal projects or contributions to open-source projects, consider adding a section to showcase your development skills.\n",

For example: \"Data-driven analyst with 4+ years of experience leveraging big data technologies to drive business insights. Seeking a challenging development role where I can apply my expertise in [specific skills] to [specific goals].\"\n",
      "2.  **Elaborate on your Skills:** Consider adding a brief sentence or two after your skills list to provide context. For example: \"Proficient in Python, Java, and Spark for data processing and analysis. Experienced in deploying and managing cloud-based solutions on AWS and Azure.\"\n",
      "3.  **Quantify your Work Experience:** This is crucial! Use numbers and data to demonstrate the impact you've made at Coca-Cola. Instead of \"Technical Support,\" try \"Provided technical support to over 50 users daily, resolving critical system issues and minimizing downtime.\" Instead of \"System Monitoring\" try \"Developed and implemented a real-time monitoring dashboard using [specific tool] that reduced system outages by 15%.\"\n",

      "*   **Work Experience:** The responsibilities listed are quite generic. They don't quantify your accomplishments or demonstrate the impact you made at Coca-Cola.\n",

      "    *   Consider grouping skills into categories (e.g., \"Big Data Technologies,\" \"Programming Languages,\" \"Cloud Computing\") for better readability.\n",
      "3.  **Quantify Work Experience:**\n",
      "    *   Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to describe your responsibilities and accomplishments.\n",
      "    *   Focus on quantifiable results whenever possible (e.g., \"Reduced data processing time by 15% by implementing a new data pipeline using Spark\").\n",
      "    *   Instead of \"Technical Support,\" try \"Provided technical support to over 50 internal users, resolving critical data issues and ensuring minimal downtime.\"\n",
      "4.  **Update Formatting:**\n",
      "    *   Use a professional and easy-to-read font (e.g., Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman).\n",
      "    *   Use bullet points to list responsibilities under each work experience.\n",
      "    *   Ensure consistent formatting for dates, company names, and job titles.\n",
      "    *   Correct the formatting in the \"to\" field under your work experience to \"Present\" or the current month/year.\n",
