      "\n",
      "*   **Comprehensive Skills Section:** You've listed a good range of technical skills relevant to big data and cloud technologies. This gives a recruiter a quick overview of your capabilities.\n",
      "*   **Relevant Work Experience:** Your experience as a Big Data Analyst at Coca-Cola is highly relevant, and the listed responsibilities provide a good starting point.\n",
      "*   **Education:** Including your B.Tech degree provides a solid foundation for your technical skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "**AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Career Objective:** The current objective is a bit generic. It states what you *are* and what you *seek*, but it doesn't highlight *what you offer* to a potential employer. It also lacks specific details about the type of development role you're interested in.\n",
      "*   **Skills Section:** While comprehensive, the skills section is just a list. It lacks context and doesn't demonstrate your proficiency level in each skill.\n",
      "*   **Work Experience - Responsibilities:** The responsibilities listed are quite generic. They could apply to many IT roles. You need to quantify your accomplishments and tailor them to showcase your big data and development skills.\n",
      "*   **Work Experience - Dates:** The \"to\" date is awkwardly formatted.\n",
      "*   **Overall Formatting:** The CV lacks visual appeal and could benefit from better formatting to improve readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "**ACTION ITEMS:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Refine Career Objective:**\n",
      "    *   Rewrite it to be more specific and results-oriented. Instead of just saying you want a development role, mention the specific types of development you're interested in (e.g., data pipeline development, machine learning model deployment).\n",
      "    *   Quantify your experience. For example, \"Big data analytics working and database warehouse manager with 3+ years of experience...\"\n",
      "    *   Example: \"Data Engineer with 3+ years of experience in building and optimizing data pipelines using Spark, Python, and cloud technologies. Seeking a challenging development role where I can leverage my skills to build scalable and efficient data solutions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Enhance Skills Section:**\n",
      "    *   Consider adding a brief proficiency level (e.g., \"Proficient,\" \"Experienced,\" \"Familiar\") next to each skill.\n",
      "    *   Alternatively, group skills into categories (e.g., \"Big Data Technologies,\" \"Cloud Platforms,\" \"Programming Languages\") to improve readability.\n",
      "    *   Even better, integrate your skills into your work experience descriptions to show how you've applied them.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Revamp Work Experience - Responsibilities:**\n",
      "    *   Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to describe your accomplishments.\n",
      "    *   Quantify your impact whenever possible. For example:\n",
      "        *   Instead of \"Technical Support,\" try \"Provided technical support to over 50 users, resolving 95% of issues within SLA.\"\n",
      "        *   Instead of \"System Monitoring,\" try \"Developed and implemented a system monitoring dashboard using Python and Grafana, reducing system downtime by 15%.\"\n",
      "        *   Focus on accomplishments that highlight your development skills. Did you automate any processes? Did you build any data pipelines? Did you contribute to any machine learning projects?\n",
      "    *   Tailor your responsibilities to the specific development roles you're targeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Correct Date Formatting:**\n",
      "    *   Change \"Till Date\" to \"Present.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Improve Formatting:**\n",
      "    *   Use a clean and professional font (e.g., Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman).\n",
      "    *   Use consistent formatting for headings and bullet points.\n",
      "    *   Add white space to improve readability.\n",
      "    *   Consider using a resume template to create a more visually appealing layout.\n",

      "*   **Career Objective:** The objective is a little generic. It could be more focused and compelling. Instead of just stating what you *are*, tell the reader what you *want to achieve* and *how your skills benefit the company*.\n",
      "*   **Skills:** While the list is comprehensive, it lacks context. Consider adding proficiency levels (e.g., \"Expert,\" \"Proficient,\" \"Familiar\") or years of experience for each skill. This gives recruiters a better understanding of your capabilities.\n",
      "*   **Education:** Consider adding your GPA if it's above average. Also, mentioning relevant coursework or projects can add more depth.\n",
      "*   **Work Experience:** The responsibilities listed are quite generic. They could apply to many roles. You need to quantify your achievements and use action verbs to showcase your impact. Instead of just listing responsibilities, describe *what you did, how you did it, and what the result was*.\n",
      "*   **Formatting:** The CV looks a bit basic. Consider using a more modern and visually appealing template. Ensure consistent formatting throughout (e.g., date formats).\n",

      "    *   Mention 1-2 relevant projects or coursework that align with your desired development role.\n",
      "4.  **Revamp Your Work Experience:**\n",
      "    *   Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to describe your responsibilities.\n",
      "    *   Quantify your achievements whenever possible (e.g., \"Improved data processing speed by 20%,\" \"Reduced system downtime by 15%\").\n",
      "    *   Use strong action verbs (e.g., \"Developed,\" \"Implemented,\" \"Optimized,\" \"Automated\").\n",
      "    *   Example: \"Developed and implemented a Spark-based data pipeline to process customer transaction data, resulting in a 20% improvement in data processing speed and enabling real-time analytics.\"\n",
      "5.  **Choose a Professional Template:**\n",
      "    *   Look for modern resume templates online (Canva, Zety, etc.).\n",
      "    *   Ensure the template is ATS-friendly (avoid excessive graphics or columns).\n",
