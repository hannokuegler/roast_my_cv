      "**FIRST IMPRESSION:** This CV screams \"generic and underdeveloped.\" It's a list of keywords followed by vague responsibilities. It lacks substance and doesn't showcase any real achievements. The formatting is also questionable, especially the \"to ['Till Date']\" under work experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "**MAJOR ISSUES:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Career Objective is terrible:** It's a rambling, buzzword-filled sentence that says nothing concrete. \"Robust experience in handling all kinds of data\" is meaningless. What kind of data? What kind of experience? And the shift to wanting \"more of development\" is confusing. Is this a data analyst or a developer? This needs a complete rewrite or, better yet, deletion. Objectives are outdated.\n",
      "*   **Skills Section is just a keyword dump:** Listing skills without demonstrating them is useless. Anyone can copy and paste a list of technologies. Where's the evidence of proficiency? What projects have you used these skills on? How have you applied them to solve problems?\n",
      "*   **Work Experience is shockingly vague:** \"Technical Support,\" \"Troubleshooting,\" \"Collaboration,\" \"Documentation,\" \"System Monitoring,\" \"Software Deployment,\" \"Training & Mentorship,\" \"Industry Trends,\" \"Field Visits\" – these are generic responsibilities that could apply to almost any job. What specific problems did you solve? What impact did you have? Where are the quantifiable results? Using bullet points with action verbs and specific accomplishments is essential. \"Coca-COla\" is also misspelt.\n",
      "*   **Education is underdeveloped:** A B.Tech from ASET is fine, but where's the GPA? Relevant coursework? Capstone projects? Any academic achievements?\n",

      "*   **Inconsistent formatting:** The \"to ['Till Date']\" issue highlights a lack of attention to detail. This makes me question the overall quality of your work.\n",

What problems did you solve? What technologies did you use? How did you impact Coca-Cola's business? This section is a black hole of missing information. The responsibilities listed could apply to literally any IT role.\n",

      "**FIRST IMPRESSION:** This reads like a template someone filled in halfway and then gave up. It's incredibly generic, lacks substance, and immediately raises red flags.\n",
      "\n",
      "**MAJOR ISSUES:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Career Objective:** This is terrible. \"Big data analytics working and database warehouse manager...\" is grammatically awkward and doesn't say *anything* about what you bring to the table or what kind of development role you're seeking. It reads like you just mashed together keywords. The mention of cloud infrastructure is vague and meaningless without context. This needs a complete rewrite to focus on your target role and quantifiable achievements.\n",
      "*   **Skills Section:** This is just a laundry list of buzzwords. Listing technologies without demonstrating proficiency or context is useless. Anyone can copy and paste a list of skills; hiring managers want to see *how* you've used them to solve problems and deliver results. The mix of skills is also a bit all over the place (C++, Java, Informatica, Azure...etc). It needs to be tailored to a specific role and backed up by experience.\n",
      "*   **Work Experience - Coca-Cola:** This is the biggest red flag. \"Technical Support, Troubleshooting, Collaboration, Documentation, System Monitoring, Software Deployment, Training & Mentorship, Industry Trends, Field Visits\" are vague *responsibilities* that could apply to almost any job. Where are the accomplishments? Where is the impact? What specific projects did you work on? What were the results? Saying you were a \"Big Data Analyst\" and then listing generic support tasks is a huge disconnect. This section needs a complete overhaul with specific, quantifiable achievements. Using action verbs and the STAR method is a must. Also, why is the company name misspelled?\n",

      "**FIRST IMPRESSION:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This CV screams \"generic and underbaked.\" It looks like someone threw a bunch of keywords at a wall and hoped they'd stick. The formatting is terrible, and the content lacks any real substance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**MAJOR ISSUES:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Career Objective:** This is terrible. It's vague, poorly written, and tells me nothing about what you actually *offer* an employer. \"In search of role that offers more of development\" is a grammatical nightmare and says you're unhappy where you are. Ditch this entirely. Objectives are outdated.\n",
      "*   **Skills Section:** Just a list of keywords. Meaningless without context. Anyone can list skills; you need to *prove* you have them. Listing C++ and Data Structures alongside Big Data tools is odd and suggests you're trying to cover too much ground. Also, the inconsistent capitalization is irritating (e.g., 'Mapreduce' vs 'Amazon Redshift').\n",
      "*   **Work Experience:** This is the biggest problem. \"Coca-COla\" (typo alert!) and \"Big Data Analyst\" sounds impressive, but the responsibilities listed are incredibly generic and could apply to *any* IT role. \"Technical Support,\" \"Troubleshooting,\" \"Collaboration,\" \"Documentation,\" \"System Monitoring,\" \"Software Deployment,\" \"Training & Mentorship,\" \"Industry Trends,\" \"Field Visits\" – these are all filler. Where's the *big data analysis*? Where are the *results*? What specific tools did you use and what business problems did you solve? This section is a black hole of information.\n",

      "**CONCERNS:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **\"Till Date\":** This is lazy. Update your CV every time you achieve something new. Saying \"Till Date\" implies you haven't done anything significant recently.\n",
      "*   **Electronics Background:** You have a B.Tech in Electronics, but you're applying for data roles. This isn't necessarily a deal-breaker, but you need to *explicitly* connect your education to your data skills. How did you transition? What relevant projects did you undertake?\n",
      "*   **Informatica and Talend:** Listing both Informatica and Talend raises an eyebrow. While knowing both is possible, it might suggest a lack of deep expertise in either. Be prepared to answer questions about why you know both.\n",

      "**WHAT WORKS:**\n",

      "**FIRST IMPRESSION:** This looks like a keyword dump disguised as a CV. It screams of someone trying to game the system without actually having the substance to back it up. The \"Career Objective\" is weak and the \"Responsibilities\" section reads like a laundry list of buzzwords.\n",
      "\n",
      "**MAJOR ISSUES:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Career Objective is Generic and Useless:** \"Fresher looking to join...\" No hiring manager cares what you're *looking* to do. They care about what you *can* do. This needs to be replaced with a concise summary of your quantifiable achievements and skills that directly align with the roles you're targeting.\n",
      "*   **Skills Section is a Keyword Salad:** Listing skills like this is meaningless without demonstration. You're just shouting buzzwords. Anyone can write \"Machine Learning\" – prove you know it. This section needs to be integrated into your experience, showing *how* you used these skills. Also, \"Data Analysis\" and \"Data Analytics\" and \"Business Analytics\" are all redundant. Choose the most accurate and impactful term.\n",
      "*   **Experience Section is a Buzzword Nightmare:** \"Machine Learning Leadership,\" \"Strategy Development,\" \"ML/NLP Infrastructure\" - as a Business Analyst with less than 5 years of experience, I *highly* doubt you led ML infrastructure development. This entire section reads like you copy-pasted a job description for a senior data scientist. The sheer volume of responsibilities is unbelievable for a single person, especially at the stated experience level.\n",
      "*   **Inconsistent Dates:** You graduated in 2018 and started this role in 2019. What were you doing in that gap year? This needs to be addressed.\n",
