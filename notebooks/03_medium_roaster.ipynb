      "**FIRST IMPRESSION:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately, it screams \"entry-level\" and \"generic.\" The objective is weak, the skills section is a laundry list, and the work experience is...concerningly vague. There's a distinct lack of quantifiable achievements.\n",

      "**MAJOR ISSUES:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Career Objective:** This is terrible. It's a rambling sentence filled with buzzwords and doesn't tell me *what* you want to do or *why* I should hire you. \"More of development\" is incredibly vague. What kind of development? Back-end? Front-end? Data Engineering? Be specific. This needs a complete rewrite.\n",
      "*   **Skills Section:** This is just a brain dump of technologies. Listing \"Big Data\" as a skill is laughable. It's a field, not a skill. You need to show *how* you've used these technologies, not just list them. The mix of languages, databases, and cloud platforms makes it seem like you're trying to cover all bases and specialize in none.\n",
      "*   **Work Experience:** This is the biggest red flag. \"Coca-COla\" (misspelled, by the way) as a Big Data Analyst for almost 5 years, and the responsibilities are...technical support, troubleshooting, and documentation? This doesn't align with the title and raises serious questions about what you actually did. \"Industry Trends\" and \"Field Visits\" are meaningless fluff. This section needs a complete overhaul with concrete examples and quantifiable results. What projects did you work on? What impact did you have? What tools did you use to solve specific problems?\n",
      "*   **Formatting/Presentation:** The inconsistent formatting (e.g., \"to ['Till Date']\") makes it look unprofessional and rushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**CONCERNS:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Electronics Degree:** A B.Tech in Electronics is fine, but you need to explicitly connect it to your interest in data and development. How did your degree prepare you for this career path?\n",
      "*   **Lack of Projects/Portfolio:** For someone claiming to be proficient in so many technologies, there's no mention of personal projects, contributions to open source, or a portfolio. This is a major omission.\n",
      "*   **\"Till Date\":** While it could be the system, it's a red flag that you haven't updated your resume since you started at Coca-Cola. It makes it seem like you're not actively looking or that you're not proud of your accomplishments.\n",

      "**WHAT WORKS:**\n",

      "================================================================================\n",
      "Okay, here's my brutally honest assessment of this CV:\n",
      "\n",
      "**FIRST IMPRESSION:** Immediately screams \"generic and weak.\" The formatting is terrible, the objective is poorly written, and the skills section is just a keyword dump. The work experience section is incredibly vague and reads like a list of basic job duties, not accomplishments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**MAJOR ISSUES:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Career Objective is a Disaster:** This is a word salad of buzzwords. It's vague, poorly written, and doesn't tell me *what you actually want*. \"More of development\" is not a coherent career goal. This needs a complete rewrite, focusing on a specific target role and quantifiable skills.\n",
      "*   **Skills Section is a Useless Keyword Dump:** Listing a bunch of technologies without context or evidence of proficiency is pointless. Saying you know \"Big Data\" and \"Cloud\" is meaningless. How proficient are you? What have you *done* with these skills? This section needs to be drastically reduced and focused on your *proven* capabilities, not just keywords you've heard of.\n",
      "*   **Work Experience is Pathetic:** \"Technical Support, Troubleshooting, Collaboration...\" This is all generic filler. Every job involves these things. You need to *quantify* your impact at Coca-Cola. What specific problems did you solve? What improvements did you make? What was the scale of your projects? Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to describe your accomplishments, not just your responsibilities. \"Field Visits\" seriously? Why is that even on there?\n",
      "*   **Formatting and Dates:** The date formatting is inconsistent and unprofessional. \"Nov 2019 to Till Date\" is lazy. The overall layout is very basic and doesn't highlight key information.\n",
      "*   **Electronics Degree Doesn't Align:** A B.Tech in Electronics with a Big Data Analyst role at Coca-Cola raises immediate questions. How did you transition into data analytics? You need to address this gap explicitly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**CONCERNS:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **\"Coca-COla\":** Typo? Shows lack of attention to detail.\n",
      "*   **Experience Level:** Started in Nov 2019... that's relatively junior. The CV reads like someone with significantly less experience trying to appear more seasoned than they are.\n",
      "*   **No Projects or Portfolio:** For someone claiming skills in programming and data science, the absence of personal projects or a portfolio is a HUGE red flag. Where's the evidence of your abilities?\n",
      "\n",
      "**WHAT WORKS:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Okay, *something* positive... listing the technologies gives a general idea of your claimed skillset, even if it's executed poorly.\n",
      "*   The Education section is at least complete (though not impressive).\n",
      "\n",
      "**BOTTOM LINE:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This CV is not going to get you past the initial screening for any competitive data science or development role. It's generic, vague, and lacks concrete evidence of your abilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**PRIORITY FIXES (in order of importance):**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Rewrite the Work Experience section using the STAR method.** Focus on accomplishments, quantifiable results, and specific projects.\n",
      "2.  **Revamp the Skills section.** Remove the fluff and focus on your core competencies with demonstrable experience.\n",
      "3.  **Craft a targeted Career Objective** that clearly states your desired role and highlights your relevant skills and experience.\n",
      "4.  **Address the career transition from Electronics to Data Analytics.** Explain how you acquired your data science skills.\n",
      "5.  **Create a portfolio of personal projects** to showcase your coding and data analysis abilities. Host on Github.\n",
      "6.  **Proofread EVERYTHING.** Fix the typos and inconsistencies.\n",
      "7.  **Improve the formatting and overall presentation.** Make it visually appealing and easy to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, this CV needs a significant overhaul. Good luck.\n",
      "\n",
