It's a rambling, unfocused sentence that tells me nothing concrete about what you *actually* want to do or what you bring to the table. \"More of development\" is vague and grammatically incorrect. This needs a complete rewrite to focus on a specific target role and quantifiable contributions.\n",
      "*   **Skills Section:** This is a laundry list of buzzwords. Listing technologies is fine, but without context or evidence of proficiency, it's meaningless. Anyone can copy and paste a list of technologies. Where's the proof you're actually good at these things?\n",
      "*   **Work Experience (Coca-Cola):** This is a *massive* red flag. \"Responsibilities\" listed are incredibly generic and could apply to almost any IT role. \"Technical Support,\" \"Troubleshooting,\" \"Collaboration,\" \"Documentation,\" \"System Monitoring,\" \"Software Deployment,\" \"Training & Mentorship,\" \"Industry Trends,\" \"Field Visits\" - these are all filler. There's *zero* indication of what you actually *achieved* as a Big Data Analyst. Where are the numbers? Where are the specific projects? What impact did you have on Coca-Cola's business? This section is completely useless in its current form. The \"Till Date\" also makes it seem like you are still there, which is confusing given that you are looking for a new role.\n",

      "*   **Lack of Projects/Portfolio:** For someone claiming skills in Big Data, Machine Learning, and Data Science, there's no mention of personal projects, Kaggle competitions, or a GitHub repository. This raises serious questions about your actual abilities.\n",
      "*   **Chronological Gap:** There is a 2019 graduation date and a November 2019 start date. While this is not that concerning, it is worth accounting for.\n",

      "*   **Electronics Degree vs. Big Data Role:** The jump from an Electronics degree to a Big Data Analyst role at Coca-Cola is a potential red flag.

      "================================================================================\n",
      "Okay, here's the brutally honest feedback on this CV:\n",
      "\n",
      "**FIRST IMPRESSION:** This CV screams \"generic and underdeveloped.\" It looks like a template was filled in with minimal effort. The lack of detail is alarming, and the formatting is basic to the point of being unprofessional.\n",
      "\n",
      "**MAJOR ISSUES:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Career Objective - Useless:** This is a vague, rambling statement that says absolutely nothing. \"Robust experience in handling all kinds of data\" is meaningless. Every candidate claims to be seeking a role that offers more development. Delete it or rewrite it to clearly state the specific role you are pursuing and why you're a good fit.\n",
      "*   **Skills - Keyword Vomit:** This is just a laundry list of buzzwords. There's no indication of proficiency level in any of these technologies. Listing 'C++' and 'Core Java' after 'Big Data' skills makes it look like you are throwing everything at the wall.\n",
      "*   **Work Experience - Vague and Meaningless:** \"Technical Support,\" \"Troubleshooting,\" \"Collaboration,\" \"Documentation,\" \"System Monitoring,\" \"Software Deployment,\" \"Training & Mentorship,\" \"Industry Trends,\" \"Field Visits\" are responsibilities of about 90% of technical roles. It tells me nothing about WHAT you supported, WHAT you troubleshooted, HOW you collaborated, or the IMPACT of your work. \"Coca-Cola\" should also be \"The Coca-Cola Company\" or similar.\n",
      "*   **Dates - Incomplete:** \"Nov 2019 to Till Date\" is lazy. Use a consistent format. And what month is it? Update this monthly if you have to.\n",
      "\n",
      "**CONCERNS:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Electronics Degree:** How does an Electronics degree translate into a Big Data Analyst role at Coca-Cola? You need to explicitly address this gap and explain how you gained the skills listed. Did you take online courses? Do personal projects? Without this, it looks like you stumbled into the role without any preparation.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Quantifiable Results:** There are no numbers, metrics, or achievements mentioned. Where are the project details? Did you improve data processing time? Reduce errors? Increase efficiency? Save the company money?\n",
      "*   **Formatting and Grammar:** The CV is bare minimum. The inconsistent capitalization (Coca-COla) is sloppy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**WHAT WORKS:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The skills section, while flawed, at least indicates the technologies you're familiar with.\n",
      "\n",
      "**BOTTOM LINE:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This CV is a major red flag. It's generic, lacks substance, and doesn't showcase your abilities or accomplishments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Priority Fixes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Rewrite your work experience:** Focus on quantifiable achievements and specific projects. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to describe your contributions.\n",
      "2.  **Provide context for your skills:** Add a brief sentence after each skill mentioning how/where you've used it.\n",
      "3.  **Address the education gap:** Explain how you transitioned from an Electronics degree to a Big Data role.\n",
      "4.  **Remove the career objective:** Focus on making the summary more concise and impactful.\n",
      "5.  **Proofread carefully:** Fix all grammatical errors and inconsistencies.\n",
      "6.  **Add detail:** This CV is extremely barebones. Recruiters prefer to see substance, not just a list of skills.\n",
      "7.  **Consider a different format:** There are better CV templates. Research them, choose a good one, and rewrite the content.\n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, you need to rewrite this CV from scratch and focus on demonstrating your value to a potential employer. As it stands, it's unlikely to get you past the initial screening.\n",
