      "**FIRST IMPRESSION:** This CV screams \"generic and underdeveloped.\" It's a list of keywords followed by vague responsibilities. It lacks substance and doesn't showcase any real achievements. The formatting is also questionable, especially the \"to ['Till Date']\" under work experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "**MAJOR ISSUES:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Career Objective is terrible:** It's a rambling, buzzword-filled sentence that says nothing concrete. \"Robust experience in handling all kinds of data\" is meaningless. What kind of data? What kind of experience? And the shift to wanting \"more of development\" is confusing. Is this a data analyst or a developer? This needs a complete rewrite or, better yet, deletion. Objectives are outdated.\n",
      "*   **Skills Section is just a keyword dump:** Listing skills without demonstrating them is useless. Anyone can copy and paste a list of technologies. Where's the evidence of proficiency? What projects have you used these skills on? How have you applied them to solve problems?\n",
      "*   **Work Experience is shockingly vague:** \"Technical Support,\" \"Troubleshooting,\" \"Collaboration,\" \"Documentation,\" \"System Monitoring,\" \"Software Deployment,\" \"Training & Mentorship,\" \"Industry Trends,\" \"Field Visits\" – these are generic responsibilities that could apply to almost any job. What specific problems did you solve? What impact did you have? Where are the quantifiable results? Using bullet points with action verbs and specific accomplishments is essential. \"Coca-COla\" is also misspelt.\n",
      "*   **Education is underdeveloped:** A B.Tech from ASET is fine, but where's the GPA? Relevant coursework? Capstone projects? Any academic achievements?\n",

      "*   **Inconsistent formatting:** The \"to ['Till Date']\" issue highlights a lack of attention to detail. This makes me question the overall quality of your work.\n",

What problems did you solve? What technologies did you use? How did you impact Coca-Cola's business? This section is a black hole of missing information. The responsibilities listed could apply to literally any IT role.\n",

      "================================================================================\n",
      "Okay, let's dissect this CV. Prepare for some tough love.\n",
      "\n",
      "**FIRST IMPRESSION:** This reads like a template someone filled in halfway and then gave up. It's incredibly generic, lacks substance, and immediately raises red flags.\n",
      "\n",
      "**MAJOR ISSUES:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Career Objective:** This is terrible. \"Big data analytics working and database warehouse manager...\" is grammatically awkward and doesn't say *anything* about what you bring to the table or what kind of development role you're seeking. It reads like you just mashed together keywords. The mention of cloud infrastructure is vague and meaningless without context. This needs a complete rewrite to focus on your target role and quantifiable achievements.\n",
      "*   **Skills Section:** This is just a laundry list of buzzwords. Listing technologies without demonstrating proficiency or context is useless. Anyone can copy and paste a list of skills; hiring managers want to see *how* you've used them to solve problems and deliver results. The mix of skills is also a bit all over the place (C++, Java, Informatica, Azure...etc). It needs to be tailored to a specific role and backed up by experience.\n",
      "*   **Work Experience - Coca-Cola:** This is the biggest red flag. \"Technical Support, Troubleshooting, Collaboration, Documentation, System Monitoring, Software Deployment, Training & Mentorship, Industry Trends, Field Visits\" are vague *responsibilities* that could apply to almost any job. Where are the accomplishments? Where is the impact? What specific projects did you work on? What were the results? Saying you were a \"Big Data Analyst\" and then listing generic support tasks is a huge disconnect. This section needs a complete overhaul with specific, quantifiable achievements. Using action verbs and the STAR method is a must. Also, why is the company name misspelled?\n",
      "*   **Education:** Fine, but the lack of GPA or relevant coursework hurts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**CONCERNS:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **\"Till Date\":** While acceptable, it's always better to put a specific end month/year to show you are attentive to details.\n",
      "*   **Electronics Background:** An electronics degree isn't inherently bad, but it raises questions about your transition into data analytics. You need to explicitly address how you gained the necessary skills and experience.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Projects/Portfolio:** For someone seeking a development role, the absence of personal projects or a portfolio is a serious disadvantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "**WHAT WORKS:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The formatting is clean and simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "**BOTTOM LINE:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This CV is a major problem. It's generic, lacks substance, and doesn't demonstrate any real value.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Priority Fixes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Completely rewrite the career objective:** Focus on your target role and what you bring to the table.\n",
      "2.  **Overhaul the Coca-Cola experience:** Provide specific accomplishments, quantifiable results, and concrete examples of your contributions. This is your biggest opportunity to showcase your skills.\n",
      "3.  **Tailor the skills section:** Focus on the skills relevant to your target role and provide context for how you've used them.\n",
      "4.  **Address your educational background:** Explain how you transitioned into data analytics.\n",
      "5.  **Consider adding a projects/portfolio section:** This is crucial for demonstrating your development skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without these changes, this CV will likely be rejected immediately. Good luck.\n",
